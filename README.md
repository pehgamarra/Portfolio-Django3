My own made portfolio in the site > https://pehgamarra.pythonanywhere.com


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This portfolio  HTML / CSS and script was made by me with a little help of AI.
I use the django base from a class from udemy where i get my django3 certificated.
Its not really implemented the django in this project. i didnt think its necessary yet, when it does, is already organized to implement the changes and use a database.
Maybe i can do a blog in these portfolio, idk i will think about something XD
